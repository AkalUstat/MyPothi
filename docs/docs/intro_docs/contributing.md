# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to MyPothi! 

This page outlines ways to contribute if you are not intersted in, or feel like you can contribute in other ways than development. 

If you wish to contribute to the development of MyPothi, please read the following [Development page as well.](/intro_docs/development)
## Overview
These areas of the project need help (if you wish to contribute in others way aside from development): 

1. Project Management (PM): This project is not very well managed. I just kind of do what I feel like it when I feel like. As such, it is hard to manage what is going on, as at any given time 2+ items are being work on. If anyone could setup up to be PM, that would be nice.

2. Beta Tester. Always nice to have beta testers to test experimental features.


## Issue guideline

If you have ideas on how to make this app better, or have a bug report, please file a github issue. If you had a discussion on Slack, please open an issue here so that outside developers and members can discuss. It also keeps a public record of decisions made. 

### Opening an issue
Please be as descriptive as possible with your issue title and body. A contributor will assign the issue the labels that it needs (more info under the management section of the docs) and it will be added to a milestone. If further discussion is needed, it will take place either on Slack (and later added to GH) or under the Issue on Github itself.
